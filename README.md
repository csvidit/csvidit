### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Vidit Khandelwal (he/him), a May 2023 graduate and Computer Science major at DePauw University in Greencastle, IN, and a past software development intern at CaptureNoire (part of Pixus, Inc.), an early-age start-up in Indianapolis. I also studied International Economics for a semester at the prestigious New College of the University of Oxford.

Take a look around! For more, visit my portfolio [viditkhandelwal.com](https://viditkhandelwal.com). I am particularly strong in Native Android app development and full-stack web development using the latest technologies, libraries, and frameworks. **I am looking for full-time roles in Software Engineering, UI/UX design, Web Development, and Product Management.**
